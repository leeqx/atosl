2016-06-01:  Now we use DW_VERSION_DATE_STR for 
  dates everywhere instead of __DATE__ __TIME__
  so a repeated build gets identical object output.
  DW_VERSION_DATE_STR is updated by UPDATEDWARFDUMPVERSION.sh
  wherever that string is needed.
  
2015-11-26:  If DWARF section data you intend to read
  with libdwarf is compressed by zlib (a section name
  like  .zdebug_info indicates such compression) libdwarf etc
  will need zlib's headers and archive or shared-library
  at build and link time. If you  do not have zlib
  everything will compile fine and will work
  on ordinary DWARF sections but libdwarf will not be
  able to read .zdebug_ compressed sections.
  zlib.h is the main zlib header and libz.a is the
  most likely zlib library you will encounter.
  
2015-11-15:  It is now possible to build
  outside of the source tree. See README.
  So configure.in changed a little.
2015-01-13:  Removed dwarfdump2 and references to it.
  dwarfdump has the (tsearch) features needed so the C++
  version no longer a benefit.
